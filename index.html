        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>
            Hackathons have become kind of lame, and lost their original
            purpose. There's always a promotion being made, gimicky prizes,
            judging rounds, recruiters, and never enough internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            So we're hosting a dumbathon. It won't be big, this first one will
            be primarily people from cryptic chat (though it's open to
            everyone!!). The purpose is to make <em>something, anything</em>.
            Something dumb, and fun, and pointless.  Something that will never
            make a cent for anyone, but will make everyone smile and say "neat"
            nonetheless. You know, what hackathons were always supposed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Will there be judging or prizes?</b><br>
            Nope
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Are there categories or a theme we're supposed to stick to?</b><br>
            Nope. Make some software, make some hardware, hell make a fucking
            chair, idgaf.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Are there rules of any kind?</b><br>
            No recruiting. No promoting a product. Otherwise, go nuts.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Who's invited?</b><br>
            Everyone in cryptic chat is invited, no matter how active you
            actually are in chat. Friends and significant others of people in
            cryptic chat are just as invited.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Will there be more redbull than there should be?</b><br>
            You betcha!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Will there be smash?</b><br>
            Are you dumb?

        <h3>Where?</h3>
        <p>
            Portland!
        </p>
        <p>
            This won't be a big event, and we don't have any real venue planned
            out yet.  We're thinking we can get a 20-person place on airbnb
            (it's a thing, for like family gatherings and stuff), and use that
            as both the venue and place to crash.  A lot of this part depends on
            how many people are able to make it. See the survey at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Staying at the venue isn't required, but you'll still be asked to
            throw down a bit of cash for it anyway, so it'll probably be cheaper
            to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Does everyone staying in the venue have to participate?</b><br>
            Keeping in mind that your project doesn't have to be technology
            related in anyway, and that it would kind of suck if the house was
            half full of people not really participating, yes. But remember,
            "baking as many cookies as possible within a 48-hour period" is a
            perfectly valid project.

          <h3>When?</h3>
          <p>
            Sometime late summer. It'll almost definitely be a Friday-Sunday,
            but you can obviously stay in portland as long as you damn please.
            This also really depends on who can go and when, so pleeeeaaaaase
            fill out the survey below.

            This is the first event like this we've ever organized. It'll
            probably have lots of things go wrong. But it'll be fun regardless!
