        <h3>Update!! WE GOT EM</h3>
        <h5><b>People have committed, the venue is booked!!! (With important
        caveats)</b></h5>
        <img src="itshappening.gif" alt="It's happening!!!!"/>

        <p>
            We reached our goal of getting at least 10 people committed to
            staying at the venue, and we haven't even gotten responses from
            everyone yet! So we're a go! We've given our credit card details on
            airbnb, the only way out now is if we die or get drafted.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Where?</b></br>
            There were some adjustments to the original plan. Due to funding
            restrictions we'll be hosting the event in Portland, Maine. We've
            been assured the spirit of the 90's is very nearly alive
            there, so there won't be much difference.</br></br>

            <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8403338">This</a> will be our
            amazing venue. It's actually a bit outside the city of Portland
            proper, but that just means we'll have more opportunity to get
            closer to nature, innovate, synergize, and collaborate! Internet
            might be a bit spotty, but we're a smart group so we'll probably be
            able to make our own. Get hyped for the best venue a Cryptic
            Dumbathon has had yet!

            Also, looks great for hammocking.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>When?</b></br>
            The venue/<!--hotel-->field is rented for the nights of friday,
            saturday and sunday, September 2-5, 2016. So check-in is friday,
            checkout is monday (labor day).
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>How can I get updates and news and dank new emojis?</b></br>
            We'll post updates and stuff in the #dumbathon room of cryptic chat.
            If you're not in cryptic chat, ask Brian or Marco to get you in on
            that noise. If you're a conscientious objector to cryptic chat,
            we'll try to remember you I guess.

        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>
            Hackathons have become kind of lame, and lost their original
            purpose. There's always a promotion being made, gimicky prizes,
            judging rounds, recruiters, and never enough internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            So we're hosting a dumbathon. It won't be big, this first one will
            be primarily people from cryptic chat (though it's open to
            everyone!!). The purpose is to make <em>something, anything</em>.
            Something dumb, and fun, and pointless.  Something that will never
            make a cent for anyone, but will make everyone smile and say "neat"
            nonetheless. You know, what hackathons were always supposed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Will there be judging or prizes?</b><br>
            Nope
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Are there categories or a theme we're supposed to stick to?</b><br>
            Nope. Make some software, make some hardware, hell make a fucking
            chair, idgaf.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Are there rules of any kind?</b><br>
            No recruiting. No promoting a product. Otherwise, go nuts.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Who's invited?</b><br>
            Everyone in cryptic chat is invited, no matter how active you
            actually are in chat. Friends and significant others of people in
            cryptic chat are just as invited.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Will there be more redbull than there should be?</b><br>
            You betcha!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Will there be smash?</b><br>
            Are you dumb?

        <h3>Where?</h3>
        <p>
            Portland!
        </p>
        <p>
            This won't be a big event, and we don't have any real venue planned
            out yet.  We're thinking we can get a 20-person place on airbnb
            (it's a thing, for like family gatherings and stuff), and use that
            as both the venue and place to crash.  A lot of this part depends on
            how many people are able to make it. See the survey at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Staying at the venue isn't required, but you'll still be asked to
            throw down a bit of cash for it anyway, so it'll probably be cheaper
            to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Does everyone staying in the venue have to participate?</b><br>
            Keeping in mind that your project doesn't have to be technology
            related in anyway, and that it would kind of suck if the house was
            half full of people not really participating, yes. But remember,
            "baking as many cookies as possible within a 48-hour period" is a
            perfectly valid project.

      <div class="row">

          <h3>When?</h3>
          <p>
            Sometime late summer. It'll almost definitely be a Friday-Sunday,
            but you can obviously stay in portland as long as you damn please.
            This also really depends on who can go and when, so pleeeeaaaaase
            fill out the survey below.

            This is the first event like this we've ever organized. It'll
            probably have lots of things go wrong. But it'll be fun regardless!

            Please fill out <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/5M8FTPY">this
            extremely short survey</a> so we can get a feel for who wants to go,
            and when they'd be able to. The purpose of this is mostly for us to
            narrow down what dates people definitley <em>can't</em> do, from
            there we'll figure out what weekend will be cheapest and things like
            that. <b>THIS IS NOT AN RSVP</b>, we're just asking questions.
