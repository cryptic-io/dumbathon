        <h3>Bigger, Dumber, More Aesthetically Pleasing</h3>

            TLDR: Seattle September 1-3 (friday, saturday, sunday), the 4th is

            Hackathons have become kind of lame, and lost their original
            purpose. There's always a promotion being made, gimicky prizes,
            judging rounds, recruiters, and never enough internet.
        </p>

        <p>
            So last year we held a dumbathon in Portland. The purpose was to
            make <em>something, anything</em>. Something dumb, and fun, and
            pointless. Something that will never make a cent for anyone, but
            will make everyone smile and say "neat" nonetheless. You know, what
            hackathons were always supposed to be.
        </p>

        <p>
            The rules of a dumbathon are simple:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Everyone's invited</li>
            <li>No recruiting or product promotion</li>
            <li>Make whatever you damn well please. Especially if it's dumb
                and useless</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This year we're keeping things spicy and moving the party to
            Seattle! Labor day weekend worked out pretty well last year so we're
            sticking with that, and will get a house for the nights of September
            1-3, (friday, saturday, and sunday, labor day is monday).
        </p>

        <p>
            For even more fuego spice we're going to actually have presentations
            this time! Sunday night we'll hang out and anyone who wants to show
            off their broken project to everyone else can do it. It's original
            ideas like this that really put Dumbathons streets ahead of any
            other hackathon.

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
            The target cost is ~$100 per person staying in the house, but we
            need to gauge interest so we can know how big of a house we can get.
            If you want to join the dumb here's what we need from you:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="#rsvp">RSVP</a></li>
            <li>Join the #dumbathon channel in cryptic chat to get announcements
                and updates and the most aesthetic memes. Ask your local cryptic
                cult member to get you an invite if you're not in cryptic
                chat already</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve column">
        <h3>You've got questions, we've got answers</h3>

        <p>
            <b>Do I have to stay in the big house? Or can I get my own separate
                place</b></br>
            The more people who stay at the house the better a house we can
            get. That said, you can get your own place if you want, but we may
            still ask for a small contribution towards the event.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Are pets allowed</b></br>
            They weren't last year, but we won't know till we pick the house.
            This answer will be updated once we do.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Isn't PAX that weekend?</b></br>
            Yup! And there's already talk of some poeple trying to hustle their
            way in. Bug cryptic chat's #dumbathon channel if you want more
            details.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Will there be smash?</b><br>
            Oh without a doubt, and rivals in-between to boot.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>When/how do I pay?</b></br>
            We'll do money once the house is reserved and we know exactly how
            much everything will be. Payment can be done by wallet-ing or
            venmo-ing to mediocregopher@gmail.
